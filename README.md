# GithubEvents
An ASP.NET 6 project that leverages Github's API and SignalR to stream events/actions (Push, Pull, Issues, Create etc) on all public github repositories.
This project looks to showcase Server-Client streaming with SignalR as it lets you monitor all events happening on Gihub almost in real-time.

# GithubEvents
An ASP.NET 6 project that leverages github's API and SignalR to stream events/actions (Push, Pull, Issues, Create etc) on github repositories.
This project looks to showcase Server-Client streaming with SignalR as it lets you monitor all events happening on Gihuub almost in real-time.
